		<description><![CDATA[I am not into sweets, and found out about Siamya by accident ( stayed in the same building where their factory is), but - once I tried it, that&#039;s it - got nicely surprised of the quality and variety of the bars they produce! Neil is amazingly knowledgeable about what he is doing, passionate about the chocolate itself and down to earth that you automatically just want to wish this company the best and see their growth moving forward. I loved original and chili bars, looking forward to come back to Chiang Mai and get more!]]></description>
